# Polyhedral Omega in Sage

Sage implementation of the Polyhedral Omega algorithm.

In the folder Python2, there is the Sage implementation of the Polyhedral Omega algorithm from 2014.

In the PO.py file the implementation was fixed to work in Python3 (current cocalc.com versions for example) and some functionality for solving ILP is possible.

The implementation can be tested in  [this public worksheet in cocalc.com](
